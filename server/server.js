Here is the Tax Information in round brackets you need to know (Why do I need a Corporation or LLC for my TCP License??
    There are many added benefits to take into consideration when applying for a TCP license under a Corporation or LLC. Obtaining a license under a business entity rather than a sole proprietorship provides business owners with liability protection and opportunities for establishing history, saving money, making changes to the business, and much more.
    Considerably one of the most valuable benefits of applying under a Corporation or LLC is the liability protection. The transportation industry in itself is generally very risky when it comes to being held liable for accidents or damages that can occur during operations. If your driver gets into a big car accident, you would not want your personal assets being at risk. If operating under a Corporation or LLC, the entity would take the hit, rather than your personal assets.
    When considering the future of your business, maintaining an active TCP license under a business entity could ensure good credit for any future endeavors due to the ability of establishing your company's history. Having the ability to establish your company's history will open your business up for opportunities to get commercial leases and loans for any vehicles you may want to add to your fleet, as well as establish a loss/run record from the insurance company to get better rates in the future.
    Having a Corporation or LLC creates a viable asset that can be sold or transferred to someone else, and also allows business owners to easily make changes to the structure of the entity without changing the TCP license itself. This is important because by adding partners to the business, drivers do not have to be solely employees but can become small shareholders or owners, working alongside partners to share responsibilities. An active TCP with a good loss/run record that has been in business for one-to-two years can be sold for anywhere from three thousand to nine thousand dollars for just the licensing.
    Another notably great advantage of applying for a TCP under a corporation or LLC are the tax benefits. LLC's and Corporations can be taxed as S-Corporations, meaning you can save thousands of dollars each year on income taxes by limiting the self-employment tax you would otherwise have to pay.
    
    
    
    
    
   Question:  What are the different TCP license types and who are they best suited for ?
    
    
    Answer: CPUC offers a total of six different license types: A, B, C, P, S, and Z. Deciding which of the six license types to apply for depends on the business activity you plan on conducting. Licenses A, B, and P, focus on strictly passenger pick up and drop off business activities, with varying restrictions or flexibility in each, while licenses C, S, and Z are catered to carriers operating more uncommon or specified transportation activities.
    License type B and P are the most common of the six licenses. These licenses cater to for-hire passenger pick-up and drop-off activities, often working with vendors such as Uber or Lyft.
    Cost:
    $1,000 plus 2.6% processing fee
    "B" Restrictions:
    Can only operate within 125 miles from the terminal address. This mileage restriction only applies to vehicles with seating capacity of 10 passengers or less.
    Best Suited For:
    Limo style companies with small and large cars that are planning to work in one area.
    "P" Restrictions:
    Can only operate vehicles with seating capacity of 15 passengers or less, and is not a transferable license.
    Best Suited For:
    Private chauffers or limo companies that cater to executive transportation with smaller vehicles but plan to operate on a statewide level.
    
    License type S, known as an "S' Permit, is catered to carriers conducting sight-seeing services. The carriers under this permit operate predetermined routes of transportation.
    Cost:
    $1,000 plus 2.6% processing fee
    Restrictions:
    Not transferable
    Best Suited For:
    Companies providing transportation in which the passenger cannot dictate the tour or venture off the track.
    
    License type Z, known as a "Z" Permit, is the most specialized type of license. These carriers do not serve the general public and instead operate under contracts with other entities.
    Cost:
    $1,000 plus 2.6% processing fee
    Restrictions:
    Cannot serve the general public, only provide transportation to those in which they hold contracts with.
    Best Suited For:
    Shuttle companies working with hotels to transfer passengers to the airport, or transportation of agricultural workers.
    
    License type C, known as a "C" Certificate, is the most niche of the six licenses. This certificate is used for companies with a primary business activity that is non-transportation, but offers transportation of clients to another location as part of their primary service.
    Cost:
    $1,000 plus 2.6% processing fee
    Restrictions:
    Cannot serve the general public.
    Best Suited For:
    Companies conducting commercial balloon operations, river rafting, skiing, or amusement parks that allow passengers to get on a car in order to be transported to another location.
    
    License Type A, referred to as "A" Certificate, provides the most flexibility with vehicles, business activity, and distance traveled.
    Cost: :
    $1,500 plus 2.6% processing fee
    Restrictions:
    None applicable.
    Best Suited For:
    Companies who will be offering a wide range of transportation services with intent to operate vehicles with larger seating capacity within a broad mileage radius.
    
    Question: When determining which of the six licenses best suit your needs, there are a few things to consider. First, think of your overall business plan, the present and future goals you have for your company; What kind of vehicles do you plan on operating? Will you be working with vendors like Uber and Lyft? How far are you willing and able to travel? Will you earn compensation per ride for your business, or will your transportation fees be covered in other areas of your company's revenue? It is important to take your long-term plan into consideration when applying for a license because you cannot change the type of license you have, once you have it. Prior to selecting a license type, it is advised to speak with a BusinessRocket TCP expert. To help you make the right decision for your company, BusinessRocket offers complimentary consultations. Calling 310-424-5558 to schedule a consultation will allow you to discuss the various licensing types listed above in more detail.
    
    
    Answer: How do I get Commercial Registration on my new or used Vehicle ?
    A common misconception about commercial registration is that simply registering your vehicle under your company name qualifies it for commercial use; this is incorrect. Commercial registration is obtained through an application with the DMV in which the vehicle is listed for commercial use, rather than personal use. When applying for commercial registration, the DMV requires a few documents to be submitted along with applicable fees. These documents include:
    Application for title
    Vehicle weight certificate
    Verification of the vehicle
    Statement of facts
    Title of the vehicle
    So, where does a vehicle owner get these documents? That depends on a few factors.
    Was the vehicle bought brand new?
    Is the vehicle used and currently registered for personal use?
    Who has the title of the vehicle? Answering these questions will dictate where to take your first step.
    1)   Are you Buying a Brand New Vehicle?
    
    When looking to purchase a vehicle brand new and finance it through a bank, your first step is at the dealership, as the dealership and the bank handle the paperwork for you. This makes it incredibly important at the time of purchasing to have a clear and direct conversation with the dealership to communicate your plan to register this vehicle for commercial use. The dealership prepares the documentation for you and - this is where that important conversation becomes necessary - will select "commercial" in the "vehicle use type" on the application for title. When the bank receives the documents from the dealership, they will then send it to the DMV and thus process the commercial registration and commercial plates to be mailed to you.
    2)  Do you have a Loan on your current vehicle and is the car registered for personal
    Use?
    
    If you have a used vehicle currently registered for personal use that is financed through a bank, the bank therefore owns the title. If the bank holds the title of your vehicle, then your first step is to go to the bank and let them know your plans. Keep in mind, though, that not every financial institution allows for commercial vehicles to be financed through them. Depending on the bank and if they allow the financing of commercial vehicles, the bank generally is the one responsible for submitting the application for switching the vehicle use from personal to commercial. Some banks may hand over the title, leaving you to complete the weight certificate and application submission on your own accord, while others may just require an updated weight certificate from you in order to submit the application themselves. This all can be verified at the time of the first step, when you speak with them in person.
    3)   Do you have a vehicle with no loan and you hold the title?
    
    The situation in which you own the title of the vehicle is only if your vehicle is paid off. In this case, you are responsible for submitting the paperwork to the DMV, regardless of whether or not the vehicle is new or used. Owning the title of the vehicle means your first step to switching to commercial registration is the vehicle weight certificate. This certificate can be obtained at any SMOG shop, body shop, or auto shop in your area. With the weight certificate and title in hand, schedule your appointment with the DMV - or risk the wait times by braving a walk-in appointment - and apply in-person. The DMV will process any applicable fees and provide any other necessary documentation for you to complete there. Once completed, the commercial registration and plates will be mailed to you.
    The process of obtaining commercial registration, if not done correctly, is one of the biggest obstacles in the TCP process, often resulting in delays and setbacks. Having an application consultant guide you through this process will help ease your mind and clarify any further questions or concerns you may have.

    Questions: How to Start the TCP License?
    
    Answer: The TCP process in its entirety is a multi-step process from beginning to end. Getting started can seem overwhelming due to numerous websites and resources sending business owners in all different directions. However, contrary to how the overload of information may make you feel, the process generally flows in a smooth and orderly fashion.
    The first step of any business endeavor is to register your business as a legitimate entity within the state. Any business you open is capable of obtaining a TCP license, however, we at BusinessRocket recommend a Corporation or LLC to start. Why do I need a Corporation or LLC for my TCP License?
    As soon as your business is registered, you should begin the process of obtaining commercial registration. Commercial registration is one step in the process that generally can take the longest to complete due to DMV processing times and delays with the dealership. While waiting to receive the commercial registration from the DMV, the Employer Pull Notice application can begin. The Employer Pull Notice application is a one-to-two week process with the EPN department at the DMV to enroll any drivers who will be operating your vehicles.
    Once the EPN is complete and the commercial registration is in hand, the TCP application can be submitted. Make sure to familiarize yourself with the different TCP license types that CPUC offers, What are the different TCP license types and who are they best suited for because the application fees are non-refundable and cannot be changed once applied.
    After a TCP application is submitted, a ninety-day pending period will begin. During this pending period, it is required that business owners enroll in a drug and alcohol testing program and each driver completes and passes the drug test. This is also the time when commercial insurance is to be finalized and electronically filed to the CPUC by the insurance provider.
    Upon completion of the drug testing and commercial insurance, an applicant will be in the home stretch of having an active TCP permit issued and be able to start operating.
    
    
    Question: What kind of car do I need for a TCP License?
    Answer: The CPUC does not have any Year, Make or Model requirements for a vehicle being added to the TCP license. However, if you plan to provide transportation services, the vehicle must be operational and registered for commercial use. It is also recommended you verify with your insurance broker and any potential vendors, like Uber or Lyft, any specified vehicle requirements.
    
    Question: How long does the TCP process take?
    Answer: If the carrier has all required documentation, a TCP can become active in as little as two-to-four weeks after submission. The process in its entirety takes an average of five-to-six weeks, with CPUC allocating a maximum timeframe of ninety days.
    
    What type of insurance do I need for a TCP License?
    A Public Liability and Property Damage insurance policy is the main insurance policy you are required to have coverage for on your vehicles. The minimum coverage starts at $750,000 for a seven-seater vehicle, and increases with larger seating capacity.
    
    What is Commercial Registration?
    Commercial registration classifies a vehicle to be used primarily for business purposes. This classification signifies to the DMV that this vehicle will no longer be considered for personal use, but instead for commercial use, regardless of who the registered owner of the vehicle is.
    
    Who needs a Drug Test for a TCP License?
    It is required by federal law that all drivers operating under a TCP license comply with a drug and alcohol screening prior to obtaining a TCP license. Owners who will not be operating the vehicles, but will employ drivers to do so, are required to enroll their drivers in drug and alcohol testing services and ensure the completion of any pre-employment, post-accident, or random drug and alcohol screening requirements.
    
    Can I drive if I have a medical marijuana card?
    Marijuana use, even with a medical marijuana card, is not permitted while operating passenger transportation businesses. CPUC follows the Code of Federal Regulations 49 Part A which states that any positive result of marijuana, cocaine, amphetamines, phencyclidine (PCP), or opioid specimen will be rejected.
    
    Can I have Drivers as Independent Contractors?
    CPUC does not allow for independent contract work regarding any vehicle listed in a TCP fleet. This means that it is mandatory for an owner to classify anyone operating his or her vehicles as a driver for their business. Any driver who is not an owner of the business is considered an employee.
    
    What is the difference between the TCP licenses?
    There are a total of six different TCP licenses offered by the CPUC. Each license varies in restrictions and flexibility relating to permitted business operations under that license type. The restrictions focus on mileage, seating capacity, business activity, and whether or not the license is transferable.
    
    What is the Difference Between the TCP B permit and P Permit?
    License type B and P are the most common for strictly passenger pick-up and drop-off transportation activities. The main difference of license type B is that it provides flexibility on vehicle seating capacity, allowing you to operate vehicles with any number of passengers within a 125-mile radius. Whereas license type P provides flexibility on mileage, allowing you to operate vehicles with less than sixteen passengers from any point to any point within the state of California. Another important difference to note is B permit is transferable, while P permit is not.
    
    Why is the TCP A Permit Preferred?
    While TCP type A is the most expensive, it is the most preferable due providing the best flexibility in all areas of operations. With type A, an operator can utilize vehicles with any seating capacity, operate from any point to any point within the state of California, conduct activity beyond passenger pick-up and drop-off, and is transferable.
    
    Do I need a Corporation or LLC to operate a TCP License?
    You do not need a corporation or LLC to apply for a TCP license. CPUC allows an applicant to obtain a TCP license as an individual, or sole proprietorship.
    
    Why is a Corporation or LLC preferred when starting a TCP License?
    Obtaining a TCP license for a Corporation or LLC ensures substantial protection, greater flexibility for changes, and high-reward for business owners. These entity types can deduct more expenses, transfer licenses, add or remove partners freely, and within two years of operation, finance vehicles and achieve lines of credit.
    
    How much does it cost to Obtain a TCP License?
    In addition to BusinessRocket’s service fee of $695, there is an application fee of either $1,000 or $1,500, depending on the type of license you apply for. The additional fee gets paid directly to the CPUC at the time of submitting the application.
    
    Can I lease a car for my TCP License?
    Yes, you may utilize a leased vehicle for your TCP operations, so long as you have adequate lease agreement and the vehicle is insured under your company’s name, not the company you are leasing from. In order for a lease agreement to be adequate, the lease must be commercial, not personal.
    
    What if my finance company says no to transferring my Registration to Commercial Use?
    The CPUC does not have any Year, Make or Model requirements for a vehicle being added to the TCP license. However, if you plan to provide transportation services, the vehicle must be operational and registered for commercial use. It is also recommended you verify with your insurance broker and any potential vendors, like Uber or Lyft, any specified vehicle requirements.
    
    Do I need a USDOT or CA number for my TCP License?
    A USDOT and CA number are only required in three situations. 1) Your vehicle is 10 passengers or more, 2) your vehicle is modified or stretched to accommodate more seats, or 3) you will be operating across state lines, also known as interstate travel.
